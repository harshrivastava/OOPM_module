# 🎮 Fantasy RPG - OOP School Project

A text-based RPG game demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming concepts in C++.

## 🎯 Features

- **5 Playable Characters**: Wizard, Sorcerer, Knight, Bard, Zoomer
- **Turn-based Combat** with unique special abilities
- **Random Events**: Battles, treasures, traps, healing fountains
- **Storyteller Narration** throughout the game
- **Boss Battle** against the Mind Flayer

## 🎓 OOP Concepts Demonstrated

1. **Inheritance** - Character → Player → Wizard/Sorcerer/etc.
2. **Polymorphism** - Each character has unique `special_move()`
3. **Encapsulation** - Private/protected members with public getters
4. **Abstraction** - Character is an abstract base class
5. **Composition** - Player "has-a" Inventory

## 🚀 How to Compile

```bash
g++ -std=c++20 dnd_rpg.cpp -O2 -o rpg_game.exe
```

## 🎮 How to Play

```bash
./rpg_game.exe
```

1. Choose your hero (1-5)
2. Survive random events
3. Defeat enemies in turn-based combat
4. Reach Turn 20 and defeat the Mind Flayer to win!
